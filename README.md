# GAZER

## Description

This project is a simple program for collecting and displaying system statistics in a web browser as HTML web page.

The program periodically executes bash commands and saves their results for later display as a web page.

The list of commands, as well as the types of graphs displayed, are specified in the JSON settings file like this *support/settings_pattern.json*.

For the program to work, you must pass the path to the settings file as an argument.

All scripts must be executed from the project root directory.
